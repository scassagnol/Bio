      <h1> Hi! I'm Shawna </h1>
      <h2> A software developer </h2>
      <p class="bio">I've made a few video games, worked with a couple of databases and have done some testing with websites using Selenium. I made this site to help myself learn and improve. I am currently researching and looking into getting a few certifications and trying to do more with the languages that I already know.<p>
